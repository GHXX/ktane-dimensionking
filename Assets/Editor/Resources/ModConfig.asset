  description: "If you think Ultracube and UltraStores are easy, this module is for
    you!\n(Please be aware that this module is very difficult if you are not familiar
    with 4 dimensional and higher rotations)\n\nThe module shows a shape which got
    more than 3 dimensions. This shape is projected into 3d space and rotates along
    its axes.\nRead the rotations, and figure out the first two numbers of the Schl\xE4fli-notation
    and submit the solution by pressing the correct vertices.\n\nManual: https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Dimension%20King.html\nThis
    module is based on Hypercube and Ultracube, both made by Timwi."
